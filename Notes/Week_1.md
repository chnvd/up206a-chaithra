This week's "thinking cap" assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that includes a spatial component (a map, chart, graphic) in regards to a topic related to urban justice. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write post with two parts:

A paragraph that summarizes the article and reflects critically and creatively about the material in your own words. 

Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? 

How does it inform your learning goals for this course?

How do you think the graphical outputs (maps/charts) were created for the article? Where did the data come from, and how do you think the outputs were created? Does it work? Why or why not?


The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.
