## Assignments

### Assignment 1.1
Task: must add introduce your Data Science project space 

https://github.com/chnvd/up206a-chaithra 

### Assignment 1.2
Search for two or more potential data sources that you may use for your research. If you are you using a web resource, make sure that they are "downloadable." Upload your datasets to your repo. First, create a folder titled "data," and upload your datasets in there.
Name of the data
Description of the data and how you may use it for your project
A URL link to the source (if you got it from a website), or a description of where you got your data from
A URL link to the data on your repo

*This week's "thinking cap" assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that includes a spatial component (a map, chart, graphic) in regards to a topic related to urban justice. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write post with two parts:*

#### A paragraph that summarizes the article and reflects critically and creatively about the material in your own words. 

In the paper 'Reading Inequality in Urban India’, Bhan and Jana (2015) re-position the discussion on urban inequality on a spatial dimension. It develops two relatively simple indexes to measure inequality: one based on household asset ownership, and another based on condition/quality of housing and access to basic services. The values are calculated at the city level, and sub-city level (at ward level). The data for the analysis is obtained from India's national census, often used in combination with a few other sources. The findings highlight that larger cities have a greater distribution of inequality in terms of asset ownership, while smaller cities have poorer quality of housing. It highlights inequality within cities (at ward levels), which have a weak relationship with the distribution of slums, despite the latter guiding the locational logic of welfare schemes.

It argues that spatial patterns of urban inequality are not mere 'location', but represent a mode of production and reproduction of the inequality in itself. This is illustrated in their discussion of how development/welfare programs with regional/city level focus produce better results in well-off wards and worse results in wards that are poorer. It proposes that this spatial dimension of inequality be made a criterion to guide the placement of welfare programs to benefit those in most need of it.

#### Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? 

This article uses relatively simple data and techniques in its analysis to produce a very critical policy insight. It uses the spatial dimension of the issue in focus as the primary mode of looking at the issue, in divergence with a more common way of approaching inequality (as a metric of the total population). They can provide a rationale for disproportionate results of earlier policy, and recommend policy direction that could correct the issues. It also argues for a shift in thinking, and the importance of spatiality not merely as a proxy for location, but as a basis for policy and action. Its simplicity strikes me. It is this ability to help readers spatialize key social issues, not merely as a percentage of the population, but a situated and reinforcing phenomenon that motivates me. 

#### How does it inform your learning goals for this course?

One of my learning goals is to be able to use spatial data science to inform policy decisions. This paper illustrates precisely that – how even the simplest analysis that looks at spatial patterns can produce insights that can structurally alter the basis of policymaking.

#### How do you think the graphical outputs (maps/charts) were created for the article? Where did the data come from, and how do you think the outputs were created? Does it work? Why or why not?

I am unsure as to the software used to create the maps. The data for it came from a mix of official databases. It uses data on statutory classification of urban settlements in India, and ward-level boundaries. The indexes are developed from a set of household-level variables collected through the Census and are in a range of 0-1. A density map is used, with color gradations varying by the ward's score for the index. It works well because the paper aims to present a spatial way to visualize inequality within cities. However, since this is a published paper, the maps used are static.

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.
