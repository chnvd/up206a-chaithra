Task: must add introduce your Data Science project space 
### Assignment 1.2
Search for two or more potential data sources that you may use for your research. If you are you using a web resource, make sure that they are "downloadable." Upload your datasets to your repo. First, create a folder titled "data," and upload your datasets in there.
Name of the data
Description of the data and how you may use it for your project
A URL link to the source (if you got it from a website), or a description of where you got your data from
A URL link to the data on your repo
### Assignment 1.3

This week's "thinking cap" assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that includes a spatial component (a map, chart, graphic) in regards to a topic related to urban justice. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write post with two parts:

A paragraph that summarizes the article and reflects critically and creatively about the material in your own words. 

The paper 'Reading Inequality in Urban India' tries to re-position the discussion on urban inequality on a spatial dimention. It  develops two relatively simple indexes to measure household asset ownership, and condition/quality of housing and access to basic sevices. Then it does a city level, and sub-city level (at ward level) analysis of the indexes to generate inequality measures. The data for the analysis is obtained from India's national census, often used in combiation with a few other source.The findings hightlght that larger cities have greater distribution of inequality, while smaller cities have worser quality of housing. It hightlights inequality withinw cities (at ward levels), which only have a weak relationship with distribution of slums, despite latter guiding the location of welfare schemes. 

It argues that spatial patters of urban inequality are not mere 'location', but represent a mode of production and reproduction of the ineqality in itself. This is illustrated in their discussion of how development/welfare programs with regional/city level focus produce better results in well-off wards, and worse results in wards that are poorer. It proposes that this spatial dimention of inequality be made a criteria to guide placement of welfare programs to benefit those in most need of it. 

Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? 
First, this article uses relatively simple data and technique in its analysis to produce a very critical policy insight. It uses the spatial dimention of the issue in focus as the primary mode of looking at the issue, in divergence with more common way of approaching inequality. They are able to provide a rationale for disproportionate results of earlier policy, and reccomodnt policy direction that could correct the issues. 
It also argues for a shift in thinking, and the importace of spatiality not as a mere proxy for location, but as a basis for policy and action. 

How does it inform your learning goals for this course?
One of my learing goals is to be able to spatial data science to be able to inform policy decisions. This illustrates how even the most simplest of looking at data spatially can produce insights that can structurally alter the basis of policy making. 

How do you think the graphical outputs (maps/charts) were created for the article? Where did the data come from, and how do you think the outputs were created? Does it work? Why or why not?
I am usure how the maps were created. The data for it came from a mix of offical data bases. It uses data on city classification, and ward-level boundaries. The indexes are statistically developed and are in a range between 0-1. A gradient is used to indicate each ward's position on the scale. It works, because the paper's aim is to present an alternative way to concieve and visualise inequality within cities. 

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.
