Week 4 Individual Coding Assignment

The purpose of this week's coding assignment is for you to advance your coding in a direction that makes sense to you, and to the advancement of your group research project. You are free to choose one of the following:

* Use this week to review: redo, add, replace, review, and/or improve upon past assignments to get a better understanding of the materials and coding structures used
What I will do: 
* Follow up on this week's lab: create isochrone maps for areas that advance your group research
What I will do: 
Isochone showing 0.5, 1 mile distance from ToDs, for multiple ToDs in same map
* Be pragramtic: combine elements from various labs to create unique outputs that specifically advance your research inquiry
* Be innovative: experiment with new datasets/features not covered in class (if this requires a new module/library not covered in class, consult with me first)
What I will do:
Add the ToD and non-ToD location, create subset of to stations from the bigger dataset and save as separate file 
Add housing dataset, and plot housing types in graph for each location 

This assignment can be as long or as short as you desire. It is meant to review and advance your understanding of course material. To submit:

* ~~create a new Python 3 notebook for your assignment~~
* provide a title and explanatory description of what the purpose of the notebook is 
* provide ample markdown cells (preferrably before and after each code cell) that explains what you are going to do, and how you interpret the results) 
* upload your notebook to your GitHub account
